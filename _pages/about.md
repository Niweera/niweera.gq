I am a web developer turned security and privacy researcher. I have published and presented on the research areas of software vulnerability remediation, web application security, and vulnerability remediation in open-source. Currently, I am a PhD student at [IMDEA Networks Institute](https://networks.imdea.org/team/imdea-networks-team/people/nipuna-weerasekara/) in Madrid, Spain. In a previous life, I contributed to the development of Sri Lanka's largest Bug Bounty Platform [Bug Zero](https://bugzero.io). 

Currently, I study the privacy and security in Android mobile applications and try to understand how we can improve the usability of Android permissions to increase and ensure user privacy.

Apart from my work, I love [tv](https://trakt.tv/users/niweera), [cinema](https://letterboxd.com/niweera/), and [indie music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3FILMDHxLj396VE3w2j8bW?si=221e46a100db4187). In my leisure time, I contribute to [open-source](https://github.com/Niweera) projects, write [technical articles](https://medium.com/@niweera), and read and [discuss philosophy](https://blog.niweera.gq). Also, occasionally I upload funny video clips to my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/NipunaWeerasekara) channel too.
