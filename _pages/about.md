I am a web developer turned security researcher. I have published and presented on the research areas of software vulnerability remediation, web application security and vulnerability remediation in open-source. Currently, I am a full-time researcher at [SCoRe Lab](https://scorelab.org). In a previous life, I contributed to the development of Sri Lanka's very own Bug Bounty Platform [Bug Zero](https://bugzero.io). Now, I am over-seeing the development of the Bug Zero platform. 

With my research, I have contributed to the development of an experimental platform [Sequza](https://sequza.io) to aid vulnerability remediation.

Apart from my work, I love [tv](https://trakt.tv/users/niweera), [cinema](https://letterboxd.com/niweera/), and [indie music](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3FILMDHxLj396VE3w2j8bW?si=221e46a100db4187). In my leisure time, I contribute to [open-source](https://github.com/Niweera) projects, write [technical articles](https://medium.com/@niweera), and read and [discuss philosophy](https://blog.niweera.gq). Also, occasionally I upload funny video clips to my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/NipunaWeerasekara) channel.
